# 🚀 GROQ Integration Guide

**GROQ** is an AI inference hardware and cloud provider specializing in ultra-fast inference speeds compared to traditional GPUs. Built specifically for running Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformers, GROQ offers exceptional low-latency performance.

## ✨ Why Consider GROQ for Your Startup?

✅ **Ultra-fast inference**: GROQ delivers performance up to 10x faster than traditional GPUs for LLM workloads
✅ **Cost-effective**: Pay-per-request model eliminates the need for 24/7 GPU operations
✅ **API-first architecture**: No server management required
✅ **Broad model support**: Compatible with popular models including Mistral, LLaMA 2, Mixtral, and Gemma

## 🛠️ Integration Options

### 1️⃣ GROQ Cloud API Integration

The simplest way to get started is through GROQ's serverless inference APIs.

🔹 Sign up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
🔹 Obtain your API key
🔹 Start making requests:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.groq.com/v1/chat/completions"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {
    "model": "mixtral",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain ESG in simple terms"}
    ]
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

### 2️⃣ Custom Model Deployment

For organizations looking to deploy their own models, GROQ offers dedicated Language Processing Units (LPUs):

🔥 **Supported Models**: 
  - Mistral 7B
  - LLaMA 2
  - Mixtral
  - Gemma
⚡️ **Hardware**: Optimized GROQ LPUs with ~3ms per token latency
🔧 **Infrastructure**: No GPU management required
